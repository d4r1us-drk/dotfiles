# Drake's Dotfiles (Void Linux - Sway Compositor)

This is just a personal repository where i store all my dotfiles, you're free
clone them and edit them as you wish. Part of this work was based on other
people's dotfiles (Distrotube for example), and it may contain scripts or
binaries that they made or modify.

This is a rice made specifically for Void Linux and it uses the sway wayland
compositor.
